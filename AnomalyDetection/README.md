# Anomaly Detection - Credit Card Frauds

### This directory contains the implementation of anomaly detection.

## `Structure of the directory:`
  * `detect.py` -> Implementation in python assuming every feature has standard distribution + visualization of data and distribution fit.
  * `credicard.csv` ->  Truncated data with anonymized features representing various transaction attributes (e.g., time, location, etc.) from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
