# Anomaly Detection - Credit Card Frauds

### This directory contains the implementation of anomaly detection.

## `Structure of the directory:`
  * `detect.py` -> Implementation in python assuming every feature has standard distribution + visualization of data and distribution fit.
  * `credicard.csv` -> Data with anonymized features representing various transaction attributes (e.g., time, location, etc.) from [Kaggle]()
 
**NOTE: For more details about implementation check comments.**
