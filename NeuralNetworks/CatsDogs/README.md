# Cats & Dogs - Neural Network

### This directory contains a neural network that predicts a cat or dog in an image.

## `Structure of the directory:`
  * `train/` -> Files with the images (small part of the dataset with cats and dogs from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiosanna/cat-dog-64x64-pixel)).
  * `Predict.py` -> Implementation in Python3 using one 64 hidden layer that gets 96% accuracy.

**NOTE: For more details about implementation check comments.**
