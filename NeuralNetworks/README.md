# Neural Networks Models

### This directory contains several neural networks applied on different datasets from **Kaggle**.

## `Structure of the directory:`
  * `CatsDogs/` -> Small cats&dogs dataset predicted with one hidden layer NN implemented from scratch (96% acc).
  * `CNN/` -> Convolutional Neural Networks models done from scratch or with TF keras' API.
  * `DeepLlayerNN` -> Generic neural network with different optimizers test on big cats&dogs dataset (87% acc).
  * `MNIST/` -> MNIST small dataset predicted with 1 hidden layer NN implemented from scratch in Julia and Python (95% acc).
  * `ResNet/` -> Implementation of Residual Neural Network applied on SIGNS dataset getting 96% on training set and 80% test set.

**NOTE: For more details about implementation check comments.**
